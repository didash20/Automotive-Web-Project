# Automotive Web Project
Create a Web app with a Car Simulator using Labview NXG and Flexlogger.

The project consists in a web server which manages a Web Front Panel with controls and indicators arranged as a
Car Dashboard. A user can interact with the different controls found in the dashboard, such as Throttle, Breaks and
Gearbox. This inputs are sent through the web server to Flexlogger which simulates the hardware found in a car and
calculates values such as acceleration, speed and RPM, depending on the inputs. Once the calculations are made, the
data is sent back to the Front Panel and is displayed on the indicators so the User can observe the Car Simulation.
